"DNS" options for grabbing the low-hanging fruits:

+ Query length.
+ Anomalous and non-regular names in DNS addresses.
+ Long DNS addresses with encoded subdomain addresses.
+ Known patterns like dnscat and dns2tcp.
+ Statistical analysis like the anomalous volume of DNS requests for a particular target.

- dns contains dnscat
- dns.qry.name.len > 15 and !mdns
